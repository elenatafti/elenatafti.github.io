                <strong>Technology, Skills, and Performance: The Case of Robots in Surgery</strong><br>
            </p>
            <p><em><a href="https://github.com/elenatafti/JMP/blob/main/JMP_ElenaAshtariTafti.pdf">latest draft</a></em></p>
            <p>
                This paper investigates the potential of new technologies to reduce disparities in the provision of
                healthcare services. Differences in providers’ skills may cause variation in patient outcomes. The
                adoption of innovations, like robots, can attenuate this problem if technological gains are decreasing in
                users’ skills or may exacerbate existing variation in performance otherwise. I show that, in England, the
                diffusion of surgical robots coincided with an improvement in average surgical performance and a
                convergence in outcomes between high and lower-skilled surgeons for prostate cancer patients. I study
                whether this pattern can be attributed to the adoption of robots using the universe of inpatient
                admissions to the National Health Service (NHS). To identify the effects of robotic surgery on patient
                outcomes, I exploit quasi-random variation in the geographic allocation of robots, allowing for
                selection and heterogeneity in treatment effects. I find that robots shorten patients’ length of stay in
                hospital and decrease the incidence of adverse events from surgery, but their effects significantly
                depend on surgeons’ skills. The robot has little impact on the performance of highly skilled surgeons,
                while lower skilled surgeons gain the most from it. I also uncover a strong pattern of negative
                selection on both observable and unobservable characteristics. Although the attainable gains are higher
                for lower-skilled surgeons, they use the robot the least. My results suggest that the potential benefit
                of a new technology largely depends on how it combines with the skills of the individual users.

                <strong>Killer Deals: The Impact of Hospital Mergers on Hospital Quality </strong><br>
            <p><em><a href="https://github.com/elenatafti/Papers/blob/main/KillerDeals_2022.pdf">latest draft</a></em></p>
            </p>
            <p>
                This paper studies the impact of hospital mergers on the quality of clinical care. We use an event study
                framework to evaluate the population of hospital mergers in the English NHS between 2006 and 2015. We find
                that mergers have immediate and persistent negative impacts on clinical quality. Our estimates indicate
                that on average, a merger increased the likelihood of death by 0.4 percentage points and the likelihood
                of readmission by 0.9 percentage points. Under very conservative assumptions, these effects are valued at
                approximately 4 per cent of annual hospital costs.

                <strong>Gender, Careers and Peers' Gender Mix with Mimosa Distefano and Tanya
                    Surovtseva
                </strong><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We use Italian Social Security data to examine the impact of gender mix among a worker's initial peers on
                their career path. By leveraging variation in gender composition within firms, occupations, and time of
                labor market entry, we find that young female workers who start their careers surrounded by more female
                peers have less successful labor market trajectories than those who start in a more balanced peer group.
                We detect no such effect on male labor market entrants. To inspect the mechanism behind this finding, we
                focus on adverse employment shocks. We show that having a higher proportion of women in one's initial
                professional network increases the probability of female workers securing employment post-displacement,
                but these jobs tend to be of lower quality. These findings are suggestive of `old boys' network dynamics,
                whereby having connections to male peers facilitates job opportunities through job leads and higher
                connections' status than females.
