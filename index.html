<h3> <strong>Technology, Skills, and Performance: The Case of Robots in Surgery</strong><br></h3>
<em><a  href="https://github.com/elenatafti/JMP/blob/main/JMP_ElenaAshtariTafti.pdf" style="color: red;">latest draft</a></em></p>
<p class="about__text">
This paper investigates the potential of new technologies to reduce disparities in the provision of
healthcare services. Differences in providers’ skills may cause variation in patient outcomes. The
adoption of innovations, like robots, can attenuate this problem if technological gains are decreasing in
users’ skills or may exacerbate existing variation in performance otherwise. I show that, in England, the
diffusion of surgical robots coincided with an improvement in average surgical performance and a
convergence in outcomes between high and lower-skilled surgeons for prostate cancer patients. I study
whether this pattern can be attributed to the adoption of robots using the universe of inpatient
admissions to the National Health Service (NHS). To identify the effects of robotic surgery on patient
outcomes, I exploit quasi-random variation in the geographic allocation of robots, allowing for
selection and heterogeneity in treatment effects. I find that robots shorten patients’ length of stay in
hospital and decrease the incidence of adverse events from surgery, but their effects significantly
depend on surgeons’ skills. The robot has little impact on the performance of highly skilled surgeons,
while lower skilled surgeons gain the most from it. I also uncover a strong pattern of negative
selection on both observable and unobservable characteristics. Although the attainable gains are higher
for lower-skilled surgeons, they use the robot the least. My results suggest that the potential benefit
of a new technology largely depends on how it combines with the skills of the individual users.

<h3> <strong>Does Contact Time Matter for Patient Outcomes? </strong><br></h3>
</strong> <em> with David C. Chan, Jonathan Gruber, and Stephenson Strobel </em><br>
<p>
This paper uses a unique source of information, Real-Time Location System (RTLS) Data, to study the effect of contact time on patient health outcomes. 
The setting of this paper is the New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, England. 
This is a large district general hospital part of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust (RWT). 
The Trust is one of the main healthcare providers in the West Midlands, covering acute, community, and primary care services. 
In 2013, RWT partnered with a United States technology company to develop a real-time patient flow and tracking solution.  
This application was intended to support staff in delivering care and to enhance efficiency through the process of providing real-time operational information across clinical areas. 
RTLS allows to perfectly observe the amount of time nurses spend with patient in hospital.
This paper exploits this data's granularity level to estimate a causal impact of contact time on patient outcomes. 
We show that direct contact between nurses and patients significantly reduces in-hospital mortality and accidents by decomposing contact time into an endogenous and plausibly exogenous component.

<h3> <strong>Killer Deals: The Impact of Hospital Mergers on Hospital Quality </strong><br></h3>
</strong> <em> with Tom P. Hoe </em><br>
<em><a href="https://github.com/elenatafti/Papers/blob/main/KillerDeals_2022.pdf" style="color: red;">latest draft</a></em></p>
<p>
This paper studies the impact of hospital mergers on the quality of clinical care. We use an event study
framework to evaluate the population of hospital mergers in the English NHS between 2006 and 2015. We find
that mergers have immediate and persistent negative impacts on clinical quality. Our estimates indicate
that on average, a merger increased the likelihood of death by 0.4 percentage points and the likelihood
of readmission by 0.9 percentage points. Under very conservative assumptions, these effects are valued at
approximately 4 per cent of annual hospital costs.

<h3>  <strong>Gender, Careers, and Peers' Gender Mix  </h3>
</strong> <em> with Mimosa Distefano and Tanya
Surovtseva</em><br>
</p>
<p>
We use Italian Social Security data to examine the impact of gender mix among a worker's initial peers on
their career path. By leveraging variation in gender composition within firms, occupations, and time of
labor market entry, we find that young female workers who start their careers surrounded by more female
peers have less successful labor market trajectories than those who start in a more balanced peer group.
We detect no such effect on male labor market entrants. To inspect the mechanism behind this finding, we
focus on adverse employment shocks. We show that having a higher proportion of women in one's initial
professional network increases the probability of female workers securing employment post-displacement,
but these jobs tend to be of lower quality. These findings are suggestive of `old boys' network dynamics,
whereby having connections to male peers facilitates job opportunities through job leads and higher
connections' status than females.
